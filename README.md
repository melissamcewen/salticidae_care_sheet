# Jumping Spider (Salticidae) Care Sheet
This was started when I started the [Jumping Spider Keepers/Husbandry FB Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1620188578256853/) and I've put it on here so it can get to a wider audience. I encourage contributions since there really isn't much out there for people who keep Salticidae in captivity.

Please add your spider's life events and morphology notes to our [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AfJG02oN4gXxtBVqQk9FszJ857RBuPF-9dLTA33eTAA/edit?usp=sharing).

## Species and sources
There are over 5000 species of jumping spider, but the most common ones kept as pets are larger species, particularly those in the Phidippus genus such as *Phidippus regius* which can reach about an inch in size (22 mm). Females are almost always larger than males. Even larger tropical members of the Hyllus genus such as *Hyllus diardi* and *Hyllus giganteus* have also recently entered the pet trade in the US and UK. Females of these species can reach 1.2 inches (33 mm) long. 

Phidippus species can easily be collected outside in the U.S. in warmer months. Otherwise, there are a few sources online to buy these spiders such as [phids.net](http://phids.net/) or several Facebook groups.

Salticidae are very different from tarantulas. Their keen eyesight and method of hunting has allowed them to evolve skills we consider much more intelligent including the ability to [quickly form and reverse associations](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635713002623), [navigate in virtual reality](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347215002353), [learn by trial and error](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03014223.2002.9518294) and [learn from observing conspecifics](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1078&context=bioscidiss).

>Weasels may be cunning, we might admire the intelligence of dogs and cats, but we can be forgiven for expecting the jumping spider, a diminutive predator with a brain not much bigger than a poppy seed, to be one of Descartes' automatons. Yet, jumping spiders, also known as salticids, alternate between entertaining and alarming us by planning prey-capture tactics ahead of time, adjusting their hunting behaviour in accordance with how the prey responds and giving us other examples of un-spider-like acumen- [One small leap for the jumping spider but a giant step for vision science](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/14/2129.short).

### Anatomy Notes
It's worth knowing a little about [spider anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_anatomy) if you are going to keep them. Some interesting facts that are relevant are:

* Spiders do not have ears but can sense sound vibrations through their hairs
* Spiders are not poisnous, they are venomous, but only a few spiders produce venom that can harm humans. None of these potentially dangerous spiders are salticidae. 

### Sexing a spider
The ease of sexing a jumping spider will depend on the spider's age and species. You can only really be sure if your spider is an adult, though depending on the species it may be easy to tell as a subadult. Hyllus giganteus males and females for example are totally different colors (females light, males dark) even as subadults. With Phiddipus regius there are often color differences from a young age, but it varies from region of origin. 

#### Epigynum
This method should work for any species, but requires a good look at the underside of the spider, which can be very challenging especially with small spiders. It's a tiny opening on the underside of the abdomen. You can see it on this Phiddipus Audax:

#### Pedipalps
Pedipalps are the two appendages on the front of a spider's head. In many species adult male pedipalps are often described as being "boxing glove"-with swollen ends vs. the straighter ones on females.

#### Abdomen shape/size

Females usually look "fatter" but it can be hard to tell the difference unless you have a male of the same species to compare. The following is an example using P. Audax from Florida from [Revision of the jumping spiders of the genus phidippus](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/G_Edwards/publication/242721233_Revision_of_the_Jumping_Spiders_of_the_Genus_Phidippus_(Araneae_Salticidae)_Occasional_Papers_of_the_Florida_State_Collection_of_Arthropods_Volume_11/links/546ba9680cf2397f7831c610.pdf):

#### Color/Markings
It's hard to tell with markings even with the same species due to geographical variation, but taxonomical references can give you an idea


## Enclosures
While jumping spiders are smaller than more common pet spiders like tarantulas, they are also more intelligent and active, so may  need more space than their small size might imply, though this is hotly debated. Some successful breeders use very small containers, others like to keep their spiders in larger enclosures. Either way it's ideal that any enclosure not open at the top, since this is where most popular salticidae species will build their nests, which will obstruct opening at the top.

Popular options
* [Phids.net](http://phids.net/enclosures.html) vented display cases (US)
* [Jamie's Tarantula's](https://jamiestarantulas.com) vented display cases for spiderlings or juveniles (US)
* [Bugzarre](http://www.ebay.com/usr/bugzarre?_trksid=p2047675.l2559) vented display cases (UK)

* [J&K Aquatics](http://www.jnk-aquatics.co.uk/reptile/vivariums.html) (UK)
* Make yourself by drilling ventilation holes in a display case.

One argument for larger enclosures is that they fastidious so they need to have room to build a nest as well as separate spaces away from the nest where they can dispose of eaten prey and defecate. Some species like *Phidippus audax* and *Phidippus regius* have also been observed constructing multiple nests for different uses, for example a separate nest for eating and another for resting.

But an argument against larger enclosures is that they may make it difficult for a small spider to find their food. Prey may also hide in more complicated enclosures such as planted terrariums.

### Substrate
Some do not use substrate as most popular pet species are arboreal and will spend most of their time climbing, but it is useful for preserving humidity for tropical species like Hyllus. Coco-fiber and orchid bark are often used for this purpose. Sand is not recommended because it can be irritating.

### Nesting 
Most common pet species like to built their nests as high as possible in their enclosure. You can provide a ledge such as a small box taped to the size or just a piece of tape for smaller spiders. What do nests look like? Well most of them are just thin silk sacs that provide very basic shelter. When molting or laying eggs they build much thicker sacs. Some spiders build multiple nests for multiple purposes such as one for resting and one for feeding.

### Cleaning 
Spider waste is usually a white liquid that looks a bit like bird droppings. If your spider enclosure looks dirty, wipe it with a damp cloth of water and vinegar, then use a microfiber cloth to buff and dry it. That will remove any waste and old webbing. Just make sure not to disturb or destroy your spider's nest while cleaning. Luckily they tend to nest in 1-2 small places.

### Moisture
Misting once a day provides enough moisture for most temperate species. Tropical species from moist environments like Hyllus need more misting and should also have additional moisture in their enclosure such as a humidity preserving substrate or a wet sea sponge. Note that spiders cannot ingest moisture gels used for other arthropods like crickets.

### Heat
If you live in a very cold climate or you live in a temperate climate and have tropical spiders, you might want to add some heating. Some popular methods include heat mats (Zilla 09936 Terrarium Heater Heat Mat, 4-Watt, 4-Inch by 7-Inch for example) and light, which is covered in the next section.

### Light
Tropical species tend to do better with additional lighting during the day such as Exo Terra Repti-Glo 2.0 Compact Fluorescent Full Spectrum Terrarium Lamp, 13-Watt (Natural Light) in the plastic canopy (Exo Terra Nano Plastic Canopy for PT2601). 

## Food
Salticidae enjoy a wide variety of prey including crickets, mealworms, moths, and flies. Crickets and flies should be the size of your spider or smaller since they can be aggressive. If you need a source of flies for very small spiders and spiderlings, a wingless/flightless fruit fly culture can be purchased online or at some pet stores and can last as a source for for a month or more. These also make a good supplement for a diet that's primarily crickets. Not much is known about jumping spider nutrition, but it may be best to have some variety. 

Some more arboreal species like *P. otiosus* are known to exclusively prefer flying prey. They may ignore crickets and other insects. Some keepers have noted that they will eat crickets if you hang them from a string and dangle them a bit to entice them.

Most spiders will eat freshly killed prey.


### Caution (Most jumping spiders cannot eat these and they can endanger your spider)
* Beetles (special caution with fireflies- they look edible but are poisonous)
* Ants (can be quite aggressive and spray formic acid)
* Other spiders (though a few jumping spiders specialize in eating other spiders)

## Handling
Many people who keep these spiders do so for macro photography purposes. So being able to manage them is useful so you can get good shots. Some general behaviorial tips for handling and taming them are:
* Don't pick up your spiders with your hands, if you do want them on your hands let them do it of their own volition. If you need to move them do it by gently coaxing them into a container with something else. This way they won't associate your hands with being attacked.
* Slowly and carefully introduce your hands into their enclosure, over time they may jump on to them out of curiousity. Once they are on your hand, do not make loud noises or sudden movements. 
* Signs you should back off are them running away or doing a "threat display" with their front legs up. Yes, they do bite if provoked enough, though they are reluctant to do so. Their venom isn't enough to seriously harm you, but it will hurt and you'll likely experience swelling and redness.
* You can also try hand feeding if your hands are easily able to hold prey in a way in which they can still grab it. They probably will not consume the prey on your hand though, most of mine grab it and bring it back to a lair of some kind to eat.
* Leave some time between doing things that might disturb them and showing your hands or camera, so they don't associate either with the annoying action. Such things include: misting their enclosure, moving them to a new enclosure, or cleaning their enclosure.
* Put their enclosures in places where you spend a lot of time and they can see you, so they get used to you.

## Life Stages

### Molting
Growing spiders molt around every three weeks. When molting they will build a thick sac and remain in it. Do not disturb a spider that is molting. When molting is done they may take some time to venture out. 

### Hibernation
Many temperate species hibernate in the winter, but those in captivity may not if they are kept at room temperature and artifically lit.

### Breeding

### Senescence
There is not much research on how long these spiders live. [Some research suggests 800 days for *Sitticus fasciger*](http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1636/04-73.1) a very small common spider. Older spiders experience wear on their feet that impairs their ability to climb many surfaces like glass, so they may benefit from adding other material they can more easily climb such as sticks. They may also have trouble with live prey and may need to be fed freshly pre-killed prey.
