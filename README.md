# Jumping Spider (Salticidae) Care Sheet
This was started when I started the [Jumping Spider Keepers/Husbandry FB Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1620188578256853/) and I've put it on here so it can get to a wider audience. I encourage contributions since there really isn't much out there for people who keep Salticidae in captivity.

## Species and sources
There are over 5000 species of jumping spider, but the most common ones kept as pets are larger species, particularly those in the Phidippus genus such as *Phidippus regius* which can reach about an inch in size (22 mm). Females are almost always larger than males. Even larger tropical members of the Hyllus genus such as *Hyllus diardi* and *Hyllus giganteus* have also recently entered the pet trade in the US and UK. Females of these species can reach 1.2 inches (33 mm) long. 

Phidippus species can easily be collected outside in the U.S. in warmer months. Otherwise, there are a few sources online to buy these spiders such as [phids.net](http://phids.net/) or several Facebook groups.

## Enclosures
While jumping spiders are smaller than more common pet spiders like tarantulas, they are also more intelligent and active, so typically they need more space than their small size might imply. Some popular enclosures include the Exo Terra Nanos and vented acrylic display cases (modified from those used for collectibles) which you can buy online at places like [Jamie's Tarantula's](https://jamiestarantulas.com/enclosures/small-spiderling-enclosures/) or make yourself by drilling ventilation holes in a display case.

Jumping spiders are fastidious so they need to have room to build a nest as well as seperate spaces away from the nest where they can dispose of eaten prey and defecate.

### Substrate
Some do not use substrate as most popular pet species are arboreal and will spend most of their time climbing, but it is useful for preserving humidity for tropical species like Hyllus. Coco-fiber and orchid bark are often used for this purpose.

### Nesting boxes
Most common pet species like to built their nests as high as possible in their enclosure. You can provide a ledge such as a small box taped to the size or just a piece of tape for smaller spiders. 

### Cleaning 
Spider waste is usually a white liquid that looks a bit like bird droppings. If your spider enclosure looks dirty, wipe it with a damp cloth of water and vinegar, then use a microfiber cloth to buff and dry it. That will remove any waste and old webbing. Just make sure not to disturb or destroy your spider's nest while cleaning. Luckily they tend to nest in 1-2 small places.

### Moisture
Misting once a day provides enough moisture for most temperate species. Tropical species from moist environments like Hyllus need more misting and should also have additional moisture in their enclosure such as a humidity preserving substrate or a wet sea sponge. Note that spiders cannot ingest moisture gels used for other arthropods like crickets.

### Heat
If you live in a very cold climate or you live in a temperate climate and have tropical spiders, you might want to add some heating. Some popular methods include heat mats (Zilla 09936 Terrarium Heater Heat Mat, 4-Watt, 4-Inch by 7-Inch for example) and light, which is covered in the next section.

### Light
Tropical species tend to do better with additional lighting during the day such as Exo Terra Repti-Glo 2.0 Compact Fluorescent Full Spectrum Terrarium Lamp, 13-Watt (Natural Light) in the plastic canopy (Exo Terra Nano Plastic Canopy for PT2601). 

## Food
Salticidae enjoy a wide variety of prey including crickets, mealworms, moths, and flies. Crickets and flies should be the size of your spider or smaller since they can be aggressive. If you need a source of flies for very small spiders and spiderlings, a wingless/flightless fruit fly culture can be purchased online or at some pet stores and can last as a source for for a month or more. These also make a good supplement for a diet that's primarily crickets. Not much is known about jumping spider nutrition, but it may be best to have some variety. 

Some more arboreal species like *P. otiosus* are known to exclusively prefer flying prey. They may ignore crickets and other insects. Some keepers have noted that they will eat crickets if you hang them from a string and dangle them a bit to entice them.


### Caution (Most jumping spiders cannot eat these and they can endanger your spider)
Beetles (special caution with fireflies- they look edible but are poisonous)
Ants (can be quite aggressive and spray formic acid)
Other spiders (though a few jumping spiders specialize in eating other spiders)
